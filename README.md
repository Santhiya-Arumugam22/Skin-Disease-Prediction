Disease Prediction in Machine Learning
Overview
	Disease prediction using machine learning is an innovative approach that leverages computational techniques to analyze and interpret medical data, assisting in the early identification and prediction of various health conditions. This project focuses on employing machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of a person having a specific disease based on a set of health-related features.

Objective
	The primary goal of this project is to contribute to early disease detection, enabling timely intervention and personalized healthcare. By utilizing historical medical data, the machine learning model aims to learn patterns and relationships within the data, allowing it to make predictions about the presence or absence of a particular disease.

Dataset
	The project utilizes a carefully curated dataset that includes relevant health features and labels indicating the presence or absence of the target disease. The dataset is a crucial component in training and evaluating the machine learning model.
	I have used the dataset downloaded from kaggle:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaushil268/disease-prediction-using-machine-learning

Data Preprocessing
	Prior to model training, the dataset undergoes a thorough preprocessing phase. This involves handling missing values, normalizing numerical features, encoding categorical variables, and any other necessary steps to ensure the data is suitable for training a machine learning model.

#Library's
	Imported Librarys are:
		-pandas
		-numpy
		-seaborn
		-sklearn
		-matplotlib
Machine Learning Model
#Model Architecture
	The machine learning model employed in this project is:
		- a decision tree
		- random forest 
		- logistic regression
		- naivebayes
		- SVM
	The choice of model depends on the nature of the data and the specific requirements of the disease prediction task.

Training
	The model is trained on a subset of the dataset, where it learns to recognize patterns and relationships between input features and disease outcomes. During the training phase, hyperparameters are tuned to optimize the model's performance.

Evaluation
	To assess the model's effectiveness, various evaluation metrics are used. Common metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. 
	The accuracy score:1.0
